## Hello people 👋 

I'm Selvibala , an AI engineer and researcher .

I like working on projects where theory actually turns into something real , especially around deep learning , decision-making and simulation-based systems .

These days , I spend my time building small to medium AI projects , improving my fundamentals and learning how to think and write like a researcher rather than just a coder .

I’m open to collaborating on AI research ideas , open-source projects or anything meaningful where learning and long-term impact matter more than hype .

If you’re interested in machine learning , research paths in AI or simulation-driven systems , I’m always up for a good conversation .

Fun facts:
         - Night time is when my brain actually works
         - I switch between coding marathons and binge-watching series
         - Board games and mystery-solving games are my thing
