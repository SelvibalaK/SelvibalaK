#Hello people 👋 
##I'm Selvibala , an AI engineer and researcher .
I like working on projects where theory actually turns into something real , especially around deep learning , decision-making and simulation-based systems .<br><br>These days , I spend my time building small to medium AI projects , improving my fundamentals and learning how to think and write like a researcher rather than just a coder .<br><br>I’m open to collaborating on AI research ideas , open-source projects or anything meaningful where learning and long-term impact matter more than hype .<br><br>If you’re interested in machine learning , research paths in AI or simulation-driven systems , I’m always up for a good conversation .<br><br>Fun facts:<br>- Night time is when my brain actually works <br>- I switch between coding marathons and binge-watching series <br>- Board games and mystery-solving games are my thing<br>
